Chapter 7: Men's Foot and Shoe Fetishism and the Disabling of Women - Summary
Main Arguments:
This chapter argues that the continued practice of wearing high heels in Western societies is a harmful cultural practice driven by men's foot and shoe fetishism. The author contends that this fetishism, which finds sexual excitement in the pain and deformation of women's feet, is a significant factor in the creation and maintenance of practices like Chinese footbinding, ballet dancing en pointe, and the prevalence of high-heeled shoes.
Structure:
The chapter begins by introducing the concept of foot and shoe fetishism, citing sexologists like Havelock Ellis and William Rossi, who describe it as the most common form of fetishism, primarily practiced by men.
The author then examines Chinese footbinding, highlighting its historical context, the process, and the motivations behind its practice. She draws parallels between footbinding and high heels, emphasizing the similarities in the resultant foot deformation and the sexualized gait they produce.
Next, the author discusses ballet, focusing on the ballet shoe and its role in creating a painful and aesthetically pleasing foot shape for the (predominantly male) audience. The pain and injuries endured by ballerinas are described as part of the appeal for foot fetishists.
The chapter then returns to high heels, exploring the reasons behind men's appreciation for them. Rossi's categorization of women's shoes ("sexy," "sexless," "neuter," "bisexual") is presented as evidence of the male gaze and the demand for shoes that create specific aesthetic and physical effects on women's bodies. The author also discusses the health consequences of wearing high heels, including bunions, hammer toes, and shortened calf muscles.
The author addresses the phenomenon of woman-blaming, specifically in the context of footbinding and harmful beauty practices, citing Mary Daly's concept of "sado-rituals." The revival of high heels in contemporary fashion is attributed to male designers like Manolo Blahnik, who are described as catering to foot fetishistic desires.
Finally, the chapter concludes by comparing high heels to other harmful cultural practices, arguing that while high heels might be seen as a matter of choice, the pressure to wear them reflects the power of male-dominated society to enforce self-mutilation on women.
Theoretical Framework:
The chapter draws upon radical feminist theory, particularly the work of Andrea Dworkin and Mary Daly. The analysis is framed within a critique of male domination and the objectification of women's bodies. The concept of "sado-rituals" is used to explain the perpetuation of harmful cultural practices across cultures and throughout history.
Argumentative Style:
The author's argumentative style is assertive and direct. She presents historical and contemporary evidence to support her claims, often citing sexologists, podiatrists, and fashion commentators. She employs a critical lens, deconstructing the language and imagery used to promote and justify harmful beauty practices. The author also uses examples from foot fetish websites and pornography to expose the underlying motivations and desires driving the demand for high heels. The tone is objective but implicitly critical of the practices and attitudes described.
