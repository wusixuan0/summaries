Chapter 2: Harmful Cultural Practices and Western Culture - Summary
Main Arguments:
This chapter argues that Western beauty practices should be understood as harmful cultural practices, analogous to those condemned by the United Nations in non-Western cultures. The author contends that practices ranging from makeup to cosmetic surgery fit the UN's criteria for harmful cultural practices, despite varying degrees of severity.
Structure:
The chapter begins by introducing the UN's concept of harmful cultural practices, primarily focusing on its application to non-Western contexts. It then shifts to analyze Western beauty practices, arguing that they fulfill the criteria established by the UN. The chapter explores the notion of "choice" in Western societies, challenging the idea that women freely choose to engage in these practices. A comparison between the veil in some cultures and makeup in the West is drawn, highlighting similarities in their enforcement and underlying societal pressures. The chapter then discusses the influence of patriarchal religion on both veiling and Western beauty standards, tracing their origins to ancient Middle Eastern cultures. Finally, the author reiterates the argument that Western beauty practices should be recognized as harmful and that governments should take action to address their negative consequences.
Theoretical Framework:
The chapter utilizes a feminist framework, drawing heavily on the UN's work on harmful cultural practices and CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). It also incorporates feminist critiques of Western liberalism and its emphasis on individual choice, arguing that this ideology obscures the power dynamics that limit women's autonomy. The author employs the concept of "male dominance" to explain the societal pressures that enforce beauty practices.
Argumentative Style:
The author employs a comparative approach, drawing parallels between Western beauty practices and harmful practices in non-Western cultures. She uses examples like labiaplasty and hymen repair surgery to illustrate the potential harms of these practices. The author also utilizes historical analysis, tracing the roots of Western beauty standards and religious dress codes to ancient patriarchal cultures. She challenges common assumptions about "choice" and "freedom" in Western societies, presenting evidence of societal pressures and constraints on women's decisions regarding appearance. The author frequently cites UN documents and the work of feminist scholars to support her claims.
