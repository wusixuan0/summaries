Conclusion: A Culture of Resistance - Summary
In the conclusion of Beauty and Misogyny, Sheila Jeffreys argues that Western beauty practices, despite being presented as choices, function as harmful traditional/cultural practices akin to those condemned by the United Nations. She contends that these practices are not merely fashion or medicine but serve as a "sexual corvée"—unpaid labor performed by women for the benefit of men, reinforcing women's subordination.
Harm and Subordination:
Jeffreys supports her claim by highlighting the detrimental effects of beauty practices on women's health, citing examples like cosmetic surgery's risks and the physical damage caused by high heels and other body modifications. She argues that these practices are not only harmful but also act as visible markers of women's subordination, comparable to foot-binding and other practices traditionally imposed on women in various cultures.
The Role of Industries:
The author emphasizes the role of powerful industries—cosmetics, fashion, advertising, medical, and the sex industry—in perpetuating these harmful practices. She argues that their profitability makes them a significant obstacle to resistance, as they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. The normalization of the sex industry, especially pornography, is identified as a driving force behind the increasing brutality of beauty practices, creating a culture where women are compelled to conform to sexualized ideals.
Difficulties in Resistance:
Jeffreys acknowledges the challenges women face in rejecting beauty practices, citing Sandra Bartky's work on the "fashion-beauty complex" and its ability to instill a sense of deficiency in women while offering itself as the solution. She also discusses the potential loss of gratification, self-esteem, and social acceptance that women might fear when challenging these norms.
Potential for Change:
Despite the difficulties, Jeffreys suggests that the rise of anti-globalization movements and critiques of consumer culture could create new opportunities for resistance. She argues that individual acts of defiance, coupled with state intervention, are crucial in dismantling the culture of sexual difference/deference that underpins beauty practices.
State Responsibility and a World Beyond Beauty Practices:
Jeffreys calls for state regulation of the medical profession and the advertising industry to curb their role in promoting harmful practices. She advocates for measures like prohibiting pornography and regulating cosmetic surgery to protect women's health and challenge the normalization of sexual objectification. The author envisions a future where women are free from the burdens of beauty practices, able to prioritize comfort and personal expression over male approval. She concludes by emphasizing the need to challenge the culture of sexual difference/deference, recognizing that while men might resist the loss of their privileged position, dismantling this system is essential for achieving genuine equality for women.
