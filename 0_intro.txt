Sheila Jeffreys, in the Introduction of her book Beauty and Misogyny, argues that while the feminist critique of beauty practices gained traction in the 1960s and 1970s, it has been challenged in recent decades. She contends that beauty practices are not about individual choice but are a form of women's oppression, becoming more extreme and harmful over time.
Jeffreys structures her argument by first outlining the development and subsequent decline of the feminist critique of beauty practices. She presents the emergence of a feminist perspective that challenged women to reject beauty culture in the 1960s and 1970s, citing authors like Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon. She then posits that this perspective was challenged in the 1980s and 1990s by liberal feminists, like Natasha Walter and Karen Lehrman, who championed individual choice, and by postmodern feminists, like Judith Butler, who viewed beauty practices as potentially transformative or simply "text" written on the body.
The author utilizes the theoretical framework of radical feminism, particularly drawing upon Marilyn Frye's concept of forces that maintain women's subordination to men. She argues that beauty practices should be understood through this lens, similar to harmful cultural practices recognized by the United Nations.
Jeffreys employs a critical and analytical argumentative style, dissecting the arguments of both liberal and postmodern feminists who defend or re-interpret beauty practices. She challenges the notion of "choice" by highlighting the coercive power of societal expectations and the increasing brutality of beauty practices. This is exemplified by her discussion of practices like labiaplasty, breast implants, and extreme body modification, which she suggests require a reframing of the concept of consent.
The author introduces two additional approaches to be further explored in the book: analyzing the involvement of men in beauty practices through transvestism/transsexualism and examining the influence of the pornography and prostitution industries on the evolution of beauty standards. Through these lenses, she aims to further demonstrate the role of male dominance in shaping and enforcing harmful beauty practices on women.
