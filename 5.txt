Chapter 5: Fashion and Misogyny - A Summary
Main Arguments:
This chapter argues that late twentieth-century fashion design became increasingly misogynistic by incorporating elements of pornography and sadomasochism, including nakedness, corsets, leather, and vinyl. The author contends that fashion, contrary to postmodern perspectives, reflects and reinforces female subordination. She explores how fashion creates and maintains sexual difference through various means, including skin display, clothing styles (skirts vs. trousers), color palettes, and the use of symbols associated with prostitution and sadomasochism.
Structure:
The chapter begins by challenging postmodern views of fashion that detach it from its political context. It then examines how fashion constructs sexual difference, drawing on examples from various cultures and historical periods. The author analyzes the suit as a symbol of male power and dignity denied to women. She then discusses the increasing pornographization of women's fashion, focusing on the incorporation of sadomasochistic imagery. The chapter examines the role of predominantly male, and particularly gay, fashion designers in this process. It concludes by critiquing feminist fashion theorists who downplay the role of fashion in women's subordination.
Theoretical Framework:
The chapter's analysis draws on feminist perspectives that view fashion as a tool for maintaining patriarchal power structures. The author challenges sociobiological explanations for fetishistic fashion, arguing that they ignore the social and cultural construction of sexuality. She also draws on psychoanalytic theory, albeit with reservations, to explore the potential psychological motivations of gay male designers who create misogynistic fashion.
Argumentative Style:
The author employs a direct and critical style, providing historical and contemporary examples to support her claims. She cites various sources, including fashion historians, designers, and fashion theorists, to illustrate her points. The author uses a combination of descriptive and analytical language, focusing on the visual elements of fashion and their underlying meanings. She directly challenges opposing viewpoints, particularly those that celebrate fashion as a form of individual expression without acknowledging its role in reinforcing gender hierarchies.
Supporting Evidence:
The chapter cites various examples from fashion history and contemporary design to support its arguments. These include:
Cross-cultural examples: The Kalabari people of Africa and the Hollywood Academy Awards ceremony illustrate the contrasting dress codes for men and women, highlighting the display of female bodies.
The suit: The historical development of the suit as a symbol of male power and its denial to women.
Sadomasochistic imagery: The incorporation of corsets, leather, vinyl, and bondage elements in designs by Jean-Paul Gaultier, Gianni Versace, Alexander McQueen, and Thierry Mugler.
The role of gay designers: The prominence of gay men in the fashion industry and the potential influence of their experiences and perspectives on their designs.
Fashion photography: The work of photographers like Richard Avedon and David LaChapelle, who contribute to the pornographization of women's fashion.
Fashion theory: The chapter critiques the work of feminist fashion theorists like Elizabeth Wilson and Joanne Finkelstein for downplaying the role of fashion in maintaining female subordination.
The chapter concludes by suggesting that the fashion industry's dominance by gay men with potentially conflicted relationships with femininity may contribute to the increasingly misogynistic trends in women's fashion. It calls for a more critical and politically aware approach to fashion analysis that recognizes its role in shaping gender relations.
