Chapter 4: Porno Chic - Summary
This chapter argues that the increasing profitability and social acceptance of the pornography industry in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have significantly influenced beauty practices.
The Rise of Pornography's Influence:
The author contends that the “sexual revolution” and relaxed censorship, along with the rise of new technologies, facilitated the expansion of the pornography industry. This expansion coincided with the industry's efforts to gain respectability, including lobbying, charity involvement, and award ceremonies. The industry's growing profitability, particularly in the US, allowed it to influence mainstream media and culture, leading to what the author terms the "pornographization of culture."
Pornography and the Fashion Industry:
The author observes that fashion advertising increasingly utilizes imagery drawn from pornography. Examples include advertisements in magazines like Vogue that feature models in sexually suggestive poses and attire. The author also discusses the trend of kiddie porn in fashion, highlighting campaigns by designers like Calvin Klein that feature young models in provocative contexts.
Madonna as a Role Model:
The chapter examines the role of Madonna in normalizing the “prostitute look” as high fashion. The author argues that Madonna's performances, particularly in the late 1980s, presented prostitution as a form of female empowerment, a view that the author critiques. The author also discusses the reception of Madonna by postmodern cultural studies theorists who praised her as a symbol of female agency and transgression.
Pornographic Beauty Practices:
The author discusses the influence of pornography on beauty practices, specifically focusing on the trend of genital shaving and labiaplasty. The author notes that the hairless genitals of women in pornography have become a new standard of beauty, leading to the rise of practices like Brazilian waxing and labiaplasty. The chapter analyzes the reasons women undertake these procedures, citing examples from interviews and magazine articles that suggest a desire to please male partners and conform to pornographic ideals. The author also criticizes the medical profession for its role in promoting and profiting from these practices.
Conclusion:
The chapter concludes by reiterating the argument that the normalization of pornography has led to the intertwining of beauty ideals with the sex industry. The author suggests that this has negative consequences for women, promoting the “slut” look and normalizing the sex industry. The chapter sets the stage for the following chapter, which will examine the fashion industry and the men who create it.
Theoretical Framework:
The chapter draws on feminist theory, particularly radical feminism, to critique the influence of pornography on beauty standards. It challenges the postmodern feminist perspective that views figures like Madonna as symbols of female empowerment, arguing instead that they contribute to the normalization of sexual exploitation.
Argumentative Style:
The author's argumentative style relies on a combination of historical analysis, cultural critique, and the presentation of evidence from various sources, including interviews, magazine articles, and industry publications. The author utilizes a direct and critical tone, challenging the perspectives that normalize or celebrate the influence of pornography.
