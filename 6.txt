Making Up is Hard to Do: A Summary
Chapter 6, "Making Up is Hard to Do," from Sheila Jeffreys' book, explores the practice of everyday beauty rituals like makeup and hair removal, arguing that these practices are harmful cultural practices stemming from and perpetuating women's subordination. Jeffreys contests the view that such practices are empowering and argues that they require critical examination.
Main Arguments & Structure:
Jeffreys builds her argument by first highlighting the lack of research on the reasons and effects of everyday beauty practices, suggesting that this stems from a perception of these practices as "natural" for women. She then proposes that these practices can be best understood as harmful cultural practices, fulfilling the criteria of:
Emerging from women's subordination and benefiting men: This is evidenced through the history of makeup, particularly its association with prostitution and the pressure on women to conform to male ideals of attractiveness in the workplace.
Creating and reinforcing gender stereotypes: Jeffreys suggests makeup reinforces the notion that women must be visually pleasing to men and conform to a narrow definition of femininity.
Being justified by tradition and appearing "natural": The lack of research and the widespread acceptance of these practices contribute to their perceived naturalness, obscuring their harmful aspects.
Potentially harming women's health: Jeffreys highlights the potential health risks associated with the chemicals in cosmetics and the physical discomfort associated with practices like hair removal.
Historical Context & Male Dominance:
Jeffreys utilizes the work of Kathy Peiss to trace the history of makeup, demonstrating its development from a practice associated with prostitution to a mass-marketed requirement for feminine respectability in the early 20th century. She connects the rise of the beauty industry with women's increased presence in the public sphere, suggesting that makeup serves as a mask and a sign of women's lack of automatic entitlement to public space. Jeffreys also discusses the role of male-dominated corporations in shaping beauty standards and marketing makeup to women and young girls.
Workplace & Social Pressures:
Jeffreys draws on Dellinger and Williams' research to demonstrate how makeup is effectively mandated in many workplaces, with women facing negative consequences if they don't conform to appearance norms. These norms, Jeffreys argues, are rooted in sexism and heteronormativity, requiring women to appear "pleasing" to men and conform to a heterosexual ideal. She discusses how makeup can be used to "mute difference," particularly for lesbians and women of color who may face additional pressures to conform.
Mental Health & Harmful Ingredients:
Jeffreys examines the problematic role of psychiatry in enforcing beauty practices, highlighting how some psychologists view makeup as a sign of mental health and enforce makeovers on hospitalized women. She contrasts this with research suggesting that women who adopt more androgynous roles tend to be mentally healthier. Jeffreys also details the potential health risks associated with the chemicals in conventional cosmetics, drawing on the work of Kim Erickson and the British government's BSE Inquiry to expose the presence of toxins and animal products in cosmetics.
Conclusion:
Jeffreys concludes the chapter by reiterating her argument that everyday beauty practices are harmful, consuming women's time, energy, and money while posing risks to their physical and mental health. She maintains that these practices are not truly a matter of "choice" but are enforced through various social and institutional pressures. Jeffreys rejects the notion that makeup can be a form of empowerment or playful subversion, emphasizing its role in maintaining gender inequality.
Theoretical Framework:
Jeffreys' analysis is informed by a radical feminist perspective that views male dominance as a central organizing principle of society. She employs a critical lens to examine the social and political forces that shape women's lives, particularly the ways in which beauty practices contribute to women's subordination.
Argumentative Style:
Jeffreys employs a direct and assertive argumentative style, using historical evidence, research findings, and anecdotal examples to support her claims. She engages critically with opposing viewpoints, particularly the notion of makeup as empowering, and offers a counter-narrative that emphasizes the harmful aspects of these practices.
